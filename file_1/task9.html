   <h1>LINEAR EQUATIONS</h1> 
    <p>An equation that has maximum degree one is known as Linear Equations. The graph of it is a straight line.
        <br>
        <br>
    For example,
    <br>
    <br>
    • y=8x-2 <br>
    •ax<sub>1</sub> + bx<sub>2</sub>-cx<sub>3</sub>=9 
    <br>
     <br>
    are some of the examples of a linear equaion in two and three variables.
    <br>

    Slope of intersection of two linear equations Linear equations
    <br>
    Y<sub>1</sub>=mx<sub>1</sub>a and
        <br>
    y<sub>2</sub> = mx<sub>2</sub>+b
        <br>
    for the points P(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and Q(<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) is:
        <br>

    m = (Y<sub>2</sub> - Y<sub>1</sub>) / (X<sub>2</sub> - X<sub>1</sub>)</p>
